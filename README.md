# Simulation of linkage mapping and GWAS in structured livestock populations


A series of simulations that try to answer the questions:

1. Should you use linkage mapping or GWAS for QTL mapping in resource intercross and advanced intercross populations of livestock?

2. How should you form the genomic confidence around the QTL in the same populations?
